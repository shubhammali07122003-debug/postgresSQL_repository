This repository contains my hands-on practice of PostgreSQL database creation, including table design, constraints, and data insertion queries

In this project, I practiced:

 Creating databases and tables

 Defining Primary Keys

 Using Foreign Keys

 Applying Constraints 

 Inserting sample data

 Writing basic SQL practice queries

This project helped me understand how relational databases are structured and how tables are connected using relationships.
